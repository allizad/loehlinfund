        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The James N. Loehlin Memorial Fund was established in October of 2023 as a non-profit through the Austin Community Foundation to honor his life and continue his legacy. It exists to invest in students, artists, and academics pursuing higher education and the arts, specifically those that focus on Shakespeare and Early Modern drama. The fund will open to applicants in 2024.
